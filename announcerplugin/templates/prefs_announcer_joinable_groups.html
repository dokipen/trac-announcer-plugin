  The following groups have been defined by the Trac administrators. These are all 'opt-in', meaning that you will not
  receive any email for them unless you choose to. They are general topics that may be added onto the CC list of tickets
  (by prepending their name with @), which can be used to bring specific attention to those people who are concerned
  with the topic. Case does matter.
